This is the repository for MMASD: A Multimodal Dataset for Autism Intervention Analysis.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by significant social communication impairments and difficulties perceiving and presenting communication cues. Approximately 1 in 54 children are on the autism spectrum, resulting in over 1 million cases nationwide. 
Machine learning techniques have been broadly adopted to facilitate autism studies and assessments. 
However, computational models are primarily concentrated on specific analysis and validated on private datasets in the autism community, which limits comparisons across models due to privacy-preserving data sharing complications.
This work presents a novel privacy-preserving open-source dataset, \textbf{MMASD} as a \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{M}odal \textbf{ASD} benchmark dataset, collected from play therapy interventions of children with Autism. 
\textbf{MMASD} includes data from \textbf{32} children with ASD, and \textbf{1,315} data samples segmented from over 100 hours of intervention recordings. 
To promote public access, each data sample consists of four privacy-preserving modalities of data; some of which are derived from original videos: \textbf{(1)} optical flow, \textbf{(2)} 2D skeleton, \textbf{(3)} 3D skeleton, and \textbf{(4)} clinician ASD evaluation scores of children, e.g., ADOS scores. 
\textbf{MMASD} aims to assist researchers and therapists in understanding children's cognitive status, monitoring their progress during therapy, and customizing the treatment plan accordingly. 
\textbf{MMASD} dataset can be easily accessed at \url{https://tinyurl.com/mr3rd2dp}.
